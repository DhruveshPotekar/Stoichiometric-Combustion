# Stoichiometric-Combustion

Problem Definition:
In this we have to compute the stoichiometric coefficients(ar) of alkanes, alkenes and alkynes and build a relationship with number of moles of atoms. And also showing it graphically.

Procedure:
First we need to build a relationship between ar and n by comparing number of moles on left and right hand sides for alkanes, alkenes and alkynes. Subsequently we will use different values of n and try solving the value of ar based on the relationship derived.

Theory:
The combustion reaction of hydrocarbon is 

CxHy +(x + y/4)O2 --> (x)CO2 + (y/2)H2O

For Alkane  x = n, y = 2n+2
For Alkene  x = n, y = 2n
For Alkyne  x = n, y = 2n-2

Substituting these in above reaction we get 

For Alkane ar = (3n+1)/2
For Alkene ar = (3n)/2
For Alkyne ar = (3n-1)/2
Result:
